# needle

Needle is a dependency injection system for Swift iOS apps. It utilizes code generation to ensure compile-time safey. If it compiles, it works.

Needle is currently in pre-release mode. There is still active-development and significant changes being made. The project is open to public to support development of Needle-extension. Using this system before official release carries significant risk.
